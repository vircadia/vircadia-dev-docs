# Environment Variables

You can alter Interface's functionality using the following environment variables.


Use the source files for QML and other resources at runtime instead of the compiled files.
```
HIFI_USE_SOURCE_TREE_RESOURCES=1
```
---
Enable the HMD debugging mode which emulates an HMD view in 2D for desktop testing.
```
HIFI_DEBUG_HMD=1
```
---
Enable the OpenVR plugin to be used with an Oculus HMD. (Useful for debugging the OpenVR plugin if you have an Oculus HMD but not a SteamVR HMD.)
```
HIFI_DEBUG_OPENVR=1
```
---
Override the metaverse URL.
```
HIFI_METAVERSE_URL=<metaverse-server-url>
```
---
Allow multiple instances of Interface to run simultaneously.
```
HIFI_ALLOW_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES=1
```
---
The Interface will have a custom default home and startup location.
```
INITIAL_STARTUP_LOCATION=Location/IP/URL
```
---
Logging to the console can be controlled with the `VIRCADIA_LOG_OPTIONS` variable. It can be set to any comma separated combination of the following options. Case and whitespace are not significant.

* `color` - Force ANSI colors depending on the message's severity.
* `nocolor` - Force ANSI colors off.
* `milliseconds` - Log timestamps with millisecond precision.
* `process_id` - Log the process ID.
* `thread_id` - Log the thread ID.

For example:
```
VIRCADIA_LOG_OPTIONS="color, milliseconds"
```
This will cause logging with millisecond precision, and color coding messages by severity.
```
VIRCADIA_LOG_OPTIONS=milliseconds
```
Will result in only millisecond precision being applied to logging.

Color is enabled by default on Unix if output is being directed to a terminal, and disabled by default on Windows.
